PBO
================
Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) problem set, which contains 25 test functions taking their domain on {0, 1}^n, where n is the length of bitstrings.

In PBO, we cover some theory-motivated function, e.g., OneMax and LeadingOnes as well as others with more practical  relevance, e.g., the NK Landscape [DoerrYHWSB20].
We also utilized the so-called W-model for generating/enriching the problem set [WeiseW18].
